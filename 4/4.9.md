# 4.9. Downloading multi-volume source works from the Internet Archive

The intranda TaskManager allows Goobi to outsource the downloading of multi-volume source works from the Internet Archive to an external, specifically ordered queue.

## Starting the plugin

The following instruction is required if you wish to call the download function from an individual step in the workflow:

```bash
/usr/bin/java -jar /opt/digiverso/itm/bin/TaskClient.jar 
    -itm http://localhost:8080/itm/service 
    -s {tifpath} 
    -d {processpath} 
    -e 
    -gid {processid} 
    -i {stepid} 
    -T {processtitle} 
    -t JDOWNLOAD 
    -n jdownload
```

## Parameters

The command parameters are explained in the following table:

| Parameter | Possible Goobi variable | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `-itm` | `http://localhost/itm/service` | URL to intranda TaskManager interface |
| `-e`, `--returnError` | - | If this parameter is met, the TaskClient will end with an error code to prevent the workflow from continuing automatically |
| `-p` | `0 â€“ 10` | Priority to execute this job |
| `-gid` | `{processid}` | Goobi process ID |
| `-i` | `{stepid}` | The workflow step ID that launches the call |
| `-T`, `--title` | `{processtitle}` | The Goobi process title for which the call is launched |
| `-t`, `--jobtype` | `JDOWNLOAD` | The job type |
| `-n`, `--templatename` | `jdownload` | Name of previously generated configuration file |
| `-s`, `--source` | `{tifpath}` | Path to media directory for the process |
| `-d`, `--destination` | `{processpath}` | Path to main process directory |

## Operation of the plugin

Once the files have been downloaded, successful completion of the job is recorded in the process log and the automated workflow step is concluded via WebAPI.
