# 2. What is the intranda TaskManager

The intranda TaskManager is a flexible application designed to coordinate various CPU-intensive tasks. Its modular structure makes it possible to add individual job types to the TaskManager and configure them. The behaviour of different plugins can vary considerably.

For each job type, tasks are processed using a plugin, with separate queues to ensure that the different jobs do not affect each other. The processing of tasks using different plugins can also be outsourced and performed on other systems or even in a cluster.
