# 3.2. Searching

If you wish to search for and check the processing of a particular job, you can make use of TaskManagerâ€™s detailed search function. This allows you to conduct a search for individual fields. By way of example, you can combine a number of search parameters such as `status`, `ID` and `title` to give you the results you need.

For ease of operation, the search function includes a help section on the right of the screen that provides information on each search parameter in the form.
